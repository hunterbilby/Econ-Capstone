# Econ-Capstone
Regression analysis on financial literacy and its correlation to those individualsâ€™ risk tolerance levels using an Eckel and Grossman Model.
Raw Data contains the information recieved from everyone who took the survey; extensive cleaning required.
Created a financial literacy survey covering topics such as compounding interest, retirement funds, markets, etc. and was granted permission to send it to all Business/Econ students.
Collected data to analyze multiple regressions using different dependent variables.
